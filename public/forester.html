<h2>Our Service </h2>
<p>
	Ellipsis digitizes and automates inventory taking and monitoring for forestry, agriculture, land use planning, water management, and geostatistics.
</p>
<p>
	By leveraging satellite data, cloud computing, and computer vision methods we provide necessary insights on landscape dynamics and conditions for performance, compliance, impact, and risk assessments and help users to minimize manual data analysis and field visits.
</p>

<h2>Acquiring Insights</h2>
<p>
	We offer a highly scalable and modular monitoring solution that captures relevant geo-information. This is done automatically, in near real time, at any scale, and for any length of time. Examples include:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Land cover and land cover changes (using high or low resolution spectral data). <br/>
		Such as a.o.: Coniferous forest, deciduous forest, rain forest, shrubland, bamboo, savanna, grasslands, bare soil, shifting sand, wetlands, settlements, infrastructure, agriculture types, mining, urban buildup, industry, and water bodies. Changes in land cover are tracked through time.
	</li>
	<li>
		Growth, health, and stress dynamics for vegetation (using high or low resolution spectral data) <br/>
		Such as o.a.: Above ground biomass, chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, leaf area, water content, and water stress.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sudden changes in the landscape (using high or low resolution radar data). <br/>
		Such as o.a.: Harvesting, mowing of grass, logging, clear cutting, demolition, construction, and open mining.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>From insights to action</h2>
<p>
	We make these satellite based insights actionable for users by combining and aggregating them to geometrics that are relevant for the user. Examples are nature reserves, buffer zones, river catchments, and administrative districts that may have certain KPIs, management requirements, or legislative restrictions on them. The data is then continuously uploaded to a dedicated database in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
	By providing an external API, users connect with this database and the information can flow seamlessly into their system. This allows for great flexibility for end user applications. The information can be plugged into models, platforms, tables, graphs, or dynamic maps. It can be as complicated or as simple as the user deems fit. Everything is supported, from simple notifications of landscape conditions that require human attention (such as deforestation in a buffer zone that exceeds yearly limits, persisting drought conditions, prolonged snow cover, or unsanctioned land use change), to integrating the stream of information into a decisions making platform. 
</p>

<h2>The benefits</h2>
<p>The service helps users to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Safe cost by digitizing and automating manual monitoring work. <br/>
		By digitizing and automating monitoring processes, time and money is saved by reducing the necessity of field visits and manual data analysis. Through digitalization and automation it also becomes possible to be comprehensive in monitoring efforts. No matter the scale of the area of interest. <br/>
		<strong>Gain: Saving time and money while conducting more comprehensive monitoring</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		Focus attention and resources to relevant areas. <br/>
		By for example locating landscape conditions that imply a violation, or that are prone to natural disasters, or that are lagging behind on KPIs, it become possible to allocate time, knowledge, and resources to those areas and instances where they can be most impactful. <br/>
		<strong>Gain: The most effective use of time and resources in reaching productivity and sustainability goals.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		Inform policy and management practices. <br/>
		Understanding landscape dynamics informs sustainable and productive land management. By making the landscape based consequences of policies and management objectively measurable, users can learn from their successes and their failures. <br/>
		<strong>Gain: Data driven land management and goal oriented improvements.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		Get notified on any red flag situations in the landscape as soon as possible. As such it enables users to act before (more) harm is done. <br/>
		<strong>Gain: Avoiding unnecessary costs or losses due to late action or inaction.</strong>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to get started</h2>
<p>Key questions to answer before getting started with automated monitoring:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What does the user whish to monitor and where?</li>
	<li>What are relevant aggregation levels for the user?</li>
	<li>How does the user wish to integrate this information in work processes?</li>
</ol>
