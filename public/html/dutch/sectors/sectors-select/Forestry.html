		<h2>Why Ellipsis</h2>
		<h3>Monitoring at the cutting edge of innovation.</h3>
		<p>
			While satellite data has been around for a while and many organizations make use of it, reliable, continuous and low threshold use by non-experts has always lagged behind. In large part, this is due to the inability of providers to completely automate the analysis and delivery process in both a reliable and affordable way.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company with an expertise in IT and AI, we use a scalable and modular analysis pipeline to deliver information on a large variety of landscape dynamics and conditions, anywhere on earth, in a uniform way. We are a front runner in leveraging the most recent developments in AI software and cloud computing, running computer vision based analyses that outperform hardcoded models by taking all data patterns into account.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company, it is our main focus to make the right insights available like a utility. As easy as water from a faucet. Our methods benefit users in usability, quality, and affordability.
