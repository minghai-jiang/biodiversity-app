    <h2>
      About the data
    </h2>

    <p>
      Ellipsis data is acquired and processed on the same resolution as the original satellite datasource. 
      We currently provide three types of information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Spectral indices, to assess the condition of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classification, to assess the land cover type of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sudden change, to assess whether an abrupt event has occurred in a region.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On top of automatically generated data we can store georeferenced human messages.
    </p>


    <p>
      We aggregate this information to both standard webMercator tiles as well as to custom polygons that are map specific.
    </p>



    <h2>
