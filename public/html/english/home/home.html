      We share the planet with an increasing number of people.
      Consequently, pressure on land grows and every square kilometer needs to
      become more productive and more sustainably managed.

      At Ellipsis we believe that actionable information on landscape dynamics
      helps you make more effective use of available resources.
      By focusing efforts on high risk and high opportunity developments in the landscape,
      we can help you achieve more productive, compliant, and sustainable land use.

      Ellipsis Earth Intelligence provides a subscription based information service on landscape dynamics. We are connected to a large variety of Earth observation satellite constalations and other data sources. With our unique computing cluster we can request, analyse, and store this data in a
      fully scalable and automated fashion. This way we can get you access to the highly up to date information that you need.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The information we acquire is always tailored to client specifications and can be gathered on any scale. From your backyard, to your entire continent. From once a year, to every day.

      Our core product is a flexible and easy to use API, that outputs the relevant tabular, geometric and visual information for all monitoring projects. Since we believe both in automation and the human touch, the API includes an elaborate georeferenced chat service to further enrich the acquired data. With this readily available API you can start doing your own analysis or develop neat applications.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In case your organisation lacks a data science or development team we can also build and host dedicated applications and monitoring services for you within the Ellipsis framework.
