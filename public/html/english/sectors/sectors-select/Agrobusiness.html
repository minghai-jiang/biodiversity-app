	<h2>Our service</h2>
	<p>
		Ellipsis digitizes and automates monitoring of land cover conditions and dynamics. As such we provide insightful, actionable, and affordable information on the status of crops and pasture, as well as on relevant changes in the landscape. Anywhere and at any scale.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our information and alert service helps agrifood investors, insurers, processors, and resellers, to automatically gather and analyse the information they need about farmers, their fields, and their environment for credit appraisal, risk & yield assessments, damage claims, and compliance checks. Thus lowering the need for manual data analysis and field visits. Field agents and agronomic advisors can also use the data to automatically locate farmers who are performing suboptimally (who are behind on expected growth curves or experiencing increased crops stress), or who are at risk of environmental threats such as poor surface water quality, drought, or pressure on resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		We provide, historic and near real time, insights on:

		All information is brought together in one geo-information platform and aggregated to agricultural plots and other relevant geometries (such as districts or watersheds). These results are updated every time new data becomes available. Our platform presents the user with requested statistics as well as locations and conditions that need human attention.
		The platform also supports information inputs by farmers and field agents, such as messages and pictures. Pictures can also be automatically analysed for, for example, crop diseases and biodiversity.

		<h2>Why Ellipsis?</h2>
		<h3>Monitoring at the cutting edge of innovation.</h3>
		<p>
			While satellite data has been around for a while and many organizations make use of it, reliable, continuous and low threshold use by non-experts has always lagged behind. In large part, this is due to the inability of providers to completely automate the analysis and delivery process in both a reliable and affordable way.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company with an expertise in IT and AI, we use a scalable and modular analysis pipeline to deliver information on a large variety of landscape dynamics and conditions, anywhere on earth, in a uniform way. We are a front runner in leveraging the most recent developments in AI software and cloud computing, running computer vision based analyses that outperform hardcoded models by taking all data patterns into account.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company, it is our main focus to make the right insights available like a utility. As easy as water from a faucet. Our methods benefit users in usability, quality, and affordability.
