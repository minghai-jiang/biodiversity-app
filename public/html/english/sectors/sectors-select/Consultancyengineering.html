	<p>
		Ellipsis digitizes and automates monitoring of land cover conditions, surface water dynamics, and landscape elements.
	</p>
	<p>
    By providing automatic and near real-time insights on the status of, and changes in, land and water dynamics,
    we generate cost and time effective geo-statistics and geo-information. This information can be used to  
    inform project management, planning, risk assessments, compliance checks, impact measurements, and custom advice.  
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
      We take a detailed inventory of relevant land cover types and landscape dynamics at any scale, both historic and 
      in near real time.
		</li>
		<li>
			We monitor landscape related KPIs, red flags, and (non-)compliance.
		</li>
		<li>
			We aggregate insights to meaningful levels and write it to a cloud-based database that is externally queryable.
		</li>
	</ul>

<div className="main-block-content main-block-content-left">
	<p>
    The information is deposited on a self-updating database that is externally queryable via our API. 
    As such you can connect this new data stream into (preexisting) information systems, models, platforms or any other application. How you choose to integrate the provided information, and with whom you decide to share it,  is completely flexible. We are always on standby to advise!

		<h2>Why Ellipsis?</h2>
		<h3>Monitoring at the cutting edge of innovation.</h3>
		<p>
			While satellite data has been around for a while and many organizations make use of it, reliable, continuous and low threshold use by non-experts has always lagged behind. In large part, this is due to the inability of providers to completely automate the analysis and delivery process in both a reliable and affordable way.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company with an expertise in IT and AI, we use a scalable and modular analysis pipeline to deliver information on a large variety of landscape dynamics and conditions, anywhere on earth, in a uniform way. We are a front runner in leveraging the most recent developments in AI software and cloud computing, running computer vision based analyses that outperform hardcoded models by taking all data patterns into account.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company, it is our main focus to make the right insights available like a utility. As easy as water from a faucet. Our methods benefit users in usability, quality, and affordability.
