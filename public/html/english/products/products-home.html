    <p>
      Ellipsis' main product is an easy to use API that allows you to query and visualize the vast amount of geodata that we acquired for our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this API our customers can start building their own apps and alert services. If needed we can also deliver full service and develop and host these apps and monitoring services for you within the Ellipsis framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      We usually acquire data at our customers request, but we maintain a few 'examples' for you to experiment with.

    <h2>
      About the data
    </h2>

    <p>
      Ellipsis data is acquired and processed on the same resolution as the original datasource.
      We currently provide three types of information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Classification, to assess the land cover type of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Measurments, to assess the condition of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sudden change, to assess whether an abrupt event has occurred in a region.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On top of automatically generated data we can store georeferenced human messages, photos and forms.
    </p>


    <p>
      We aggregate this information to both standard webMercator tiles as well as to custom polygons that are map specific.
    </p>



    <h2>
        Accessibility
    </h2>

    <p>
      Ellipsis maintains various monitoring services for a broad range of customers.
      Some of these services are public and can be viewed and used by anyone,
      others are private and can only be accessed if you have the required login credentials.
