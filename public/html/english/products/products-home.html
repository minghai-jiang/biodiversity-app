      Ellipsis' main product is an easy to use API that allows you to query and visualize the vast amount of geographic information in our database. The API includes an elaborate georeferenced chat service.

    <h2>
      About the data
    </h2>

    <p>
      Ellipsis data is acquired and processed on the same resolution as the original satellite datasource.
      We currently provide three types of information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Spectral indices, to assess the condition of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classification, to assess the land cover type of a region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sudden change, to assess whether an abrupt event has occurred in a region.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On top of automatically generated data we can store georeferenced human messages.
    </p>


    <p>
      We aggregate this information to both standard webMercator tiles as well as to custom polygons that are map specific.
    </p>



    <h2>
        Accessibility
    </h2>

    <p>
      Ellipsis maintains various monitoring services for a broad range of customers.
      Some of these maps are public and can be viewed and used by anyone,
      others are private and can only be accessed if you have the required login credentials.
