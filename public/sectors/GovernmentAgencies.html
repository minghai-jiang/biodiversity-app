		<li>
			We monitoring for KPIs and (non-)compliance to land use or land management agreements in agriculture, natural resource management, surface water management or otherwise.
		</li>
		<li>

		The information (satellite imagery, numerical, and textual data) is deposited on a self-updating database. This database connects to your existing IT infrastructure in a modular way. Via an external API, all the necessary information can run seamlessly in (already existing) information systems, statistical reports, or platforms. How you choose to integrate the provided information is completely flexible and we are always on standby to advice!

		<h2>Why Ellipsis?</h2>
		<h3>Monitoring at the cutting edge of innovation.</h3>
		<p>
			While satellite data has been around for a while and many organizations make use of it, reliable, continuous and low threshold use by non-experts has always lagged behind. In large part, this is due to the inability of providers to completely automate the analysis and delivery process in both a reliable and affordable way.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company with an expertise in IT and AI, we use a scalable and modular analysis pipeline to deliver information on a large variety of landscape dynamics and conditions, anywhere on earth, in a uniform way. We are a front runner in leveraging the most recent developments in AI software and cloud computing, running computer vision based analyses that outperform hardcoded models by taking all data patterns into account.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company, it is our main focus to make the right insights available like a utility. As easy as water from a faucet. Our methods benefit users in usability, quality, and affordability.
