	<h2>Our service</h2>
	<p>
		Ellipsis provides insightful, actionable, and affordable information on the status of, and changes in, landscape conditions. We can monitor anything that becomes visible on satellite imagery, such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Land cover types and changes
		</li>
		<li>
			Surface water quality and dynamics
		</li>
		<li>
			Landscape and vegetation conditions
		</li>
		<li>
			Growth, health, and (drought) stress trends of a.o. crops and pasture
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    By making this information available on a subscription basis for any period of time, 
    we support data driven development, land management, and water management. 
    This allows you to focus your limited time and resources to where it is most effective, and to measure impact to inform future action. During the project period, but also long after that by your (local) partners.
	</p>
	<p>
		The information that is generated by our monitoring system is deposited on a self-updating database and can be accessed via our viewer application for low threshold analysis. It is also possible to connect the data to (already existing) information systems, platforms, alert services or any other application. How you choose to integrate the provided information, and with whom you decide to share it, is completely flexible. We are always on standby to advise!

		<h2>Information you can trust</h2>
		<p>
      (Local) experts or partner organizations with knowledge of the landscape can have a key role in defining relevant land cover types, landscape and landscape elements, and changes therein. For this, we use  a low threshold digital environment where stakeholders can view the satellite data and  show us how they classify what they see and what they find relevant. 
      This way local stakeholders can have a leading role in defining what we monitor, how often, and on which levels of 
      aggregation. 
      As they are usually also the end users of the information that we make available, we wouldn't
      have it any other way!
		</p>
		<p>
			We are 100% transparent about our analysis process and our models, which are always objectively tested for accuracy.

		<h2>Why Ellipsis?</h2>
		<h3>Monitoring at the cutting edge of innovation.</h3>
		<p>
			While satellite data has been around for a while and many organizations make use of it, reliable, continuous and low threshold use by non-experts has always lagged behind. In large part, this is due to the inability of providers to completely automate the analysis and delivery process in both a reliable and affordable way.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company with an expertise in IT and AI, we use a scalable and modular analysis pipeline to deliver information on a large variety of landscape dynamics and conditions, anywhere on earth, in a uniform way. We are a front runner in leveraging the most recent developments in AI software and cloud computing, running computer vision based analyses that outperform hardcoded models by taking all data patterns into account.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a company, it is our main focus to make the right insights available like a utility. As easy as water from a faucet. Our methods benefit users in usability, quality, and affordability.
